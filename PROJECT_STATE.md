# STC PROJECT STATE

Last updated: 2026-09-21
Current software version: v0.9.0
Repository: engmeldkroury-pixel/stc-competition-engine
Default branch: main

## Mission

Build a safe competition-assistant engine for TradingView The Leap paper-trading competitions with deterministic processing, automated verification, human approval before any order entry, and no real-money auto-execution.

## Accepted governance

- Automated tests are the primary verification gate.
- Human approval remains mandatory before competition order entry.
- No real-money order execution is implemented.
- Provider identity must be preserved; silent cross-provider substitution is blocked.
- Execution-time approval must fail closed if trusted quote/market evidence is missing, stale, mismatched, future-dated, or untrusted.
- Hostinger/MySQL bridge is the persistent cloud source of truth for serverless event results.
- TradingView MCP is treated as market/context evidence and alert transport support, not an execution account API.

## Implemented

### Competition/risk core
- Official competition profiles for AMP Futures Sep 2026 and Capital.com Africa Sep/Oct 2026.
- Symbol allowlists and maximum open-position rules.
- Transaction-rate protection.
- Minimum qualifying trading-day tracking.
- Realized-P/L scoring basis.
- Configurable risk-fraction guard.

### Analysis/signals
- Local EMA20, EMA50, RSI14, ATR14, MACD, momentum analysis.
- Multi-factor signal scoring with LONG/SHORT/WAIT output.
- Deterministic signal IDs for bridge events.
- Dynamic approval envelopes with validity, price tolerance, market-state hash, rule version, news and volatility revalidation.

### Data/provider safety
- Exact-provider capability matrix for the 10 Capital.com competition symbols.
- Local indicator fallback from exact-provider OHLCV when native technicals are unavailable.
- Explicit delayed-OHLCV warning.
- Silent provider substitution blocked.

### Bridge/cloud processing
- Authenticated claim/ack bridge client.
- Idempotent bridge event processing.
- GitHub Actions worker for Hostinger bridge events.
- Serverless processor that returns full decision payload back to Hostinger/MySQL in Ack.
- Deterministic pipeline receipt (v0.9) containing:
  - receipt_id
  - event_id
  - canonical payload SHA-256
  - competition_id
  - symbol
  - event_time
  - status/action
  - signal_id when applicable

### Approval hardening
- Approval request no longer accepts caller-supplied quote/market verification booleans.
- Persisted execution evidence model.
- Target/provider/competition matching.
- Freshness limits.
- Future-timestamp rejection.
- Streaming requirement for direct TradingView quote evidence.
- Safe Mode and Kill Switch.
- Approval remains manual-only.

### Automated verification
- Pytest suite exists for API, risk, bridge, serverless worker, capability matrix, approval, execution-context and deterministic event behavior.
- .github/workflows/stc-ci.yml added in v0.9:
  - runs on push to main
  - runs on pull requests to main
  - supports manual workflow_dispatch
  - executes pytest -q

## Live TradingView MCP evidence captured 2026-09-21

Read-only checks only. No alert creation and no order execution were performed.

- CAPITALCOM:XAUUSD 15m OHLCV: SUCCESS; 120 bars returned.
- OHLCV notice explicitly states delayed data and says latest bar is not a live quote.
- CAPITALCOM:XAUUSD news: SUCCESS.
- USD economic calendar: SUCCESS.
- Alert list: SUCCESS.
- Alert log: SUCCESS; prior webhook deliveries include HTTP 200 responses after earlier test failures.
- Batch quote read for all 10 Capital.com symbols at the time of check: no quote rows returned.
- Direct EURUSD quote/technicals at the time of check: TradingView scanner returned HTTP 429.
- XAUUSD native technicals at the time of check: TradingView scanner returned HTTP 429.

Interpretation: historical/context market data and alert plumbing are available; execution-time quote readiness must still be treated dynamically and fail closed whenever the direct quote path is unavailable.

## Current acceptance status

### Ready
- Competition-rule engine.
- Signal generation.
- Exact-provider analysis fallback.
- TradingView -> Hostinger bridge transport.
- Deterministic cloud processing result.
- Human approval envelope generation.
- Pipeline reconciliation receipt.
- Automated CI test gate definition.
- Safe/fail-closed approval logic.

### Not yet evidence-complete
- A confirmed green CI run for the latest v0.9 commit is not yet visible through the current GitHub connector.
- End-to-end reconciliation of one new v0.9 TradingView event through Hostinger/MySQL with the new receipt still requires one real incoming event after deployment/current code pull.
- Execution-time direct quote availability is dynamic and was unavailable/rate-limited during the latest read-only MCP check.
- No broker/execution account read/write API is available in the verified TradingView MCP path. Manual execution remains required.

## Owner boundary

The system may analyze, rank signals, validate competition rules, generate approval envelopes, and reconcile evidence automatically.

The system must NOT place a competition or real-money order automatically. The owner remains the final approval and execution authority.

## Next bounded action

1. Confirm the latest GitHub CI run is green.
2. Process one new TradingView test/competition event through the deployed bridge.
3. Confirm Hostinger/MySQL stores the Ack result containing the v0.9 pipeline receipt.
4. Only then mark the transport + analysis + reconciliation MVP as end-to-end verified.
